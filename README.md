Tired of boring, old-school weather apps that give you the same old 'Good', 'Moderate', 'Unhealthy' ratings? Yawn. 😴

Welcome to **Surat Ki Actual Air Quality**, the only dashboard that tells you if the air outside is just "a bit spicy" or if you're basically living on Mars. We pull real-time data straight from the Science Center in Surat and serve it to you with the Gen-Z flair you didn't know you needed.

## 🚀 Features That Slap

*   **Real-Time Data:** No cap, we get the freshest data from the Science Center, Surat.
*   **Dual AQI Cards:** We show you the "Overall AQI" and a special "AQI (w/o PM10)" when it's raining, because rain makes PM10 go wild and skews the results. We got you. 🤙
*   **Smart UI:** The "rainy day" card and a quick tip only show up when it's actually raining. Big brain moves only.
*   **Gen-Z Tooltips:** Click the little info icons to get the tea on pollutants like PM2.5 ("The Sneaky One") and CO ("The Silent Killer").
*   **Dark/Light Mode:** For when you're doomscrolling at 3 AM or vibing in the sunshine. 🌞/🌚
*   **Historical Chart:** Peep the trends from the last 24 hours with a slick chart.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This dashboard is for informational and entertainment purposes. Don't make major life decisions based on it, unless you enjoy chaos and living on the edge. We're not responsible if you decide to go for a jog during a 'Severe' AQI day because the summary said "Just don't breathe, Mu fulaa lo." 😉
